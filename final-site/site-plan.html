      <h3>Jackson's Studio</h3>
      <p>
       Welcome to Jackson's Studio! This website is to give you all of information about the piano lessons that I am offering. I am experienced in giving piano lessons before and I am great with kids. The lessons will take place in my home and I won't be able to drive to give a lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        These lessons are designed for either beginner or intermediate students. My main purpose in giving piano lessons is to be able to have the opportunity to inspire people who are just beginning. Piano can be very frustrating at first, and I want to be able to help kids get over that first stepso that they can continue to improve whenever I'm done teaching them.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Jackson Spencer and I am a computer science Major at BYU-Idaho. I used to go to school for Piano Performance, but decided to pursue music as a hobby. I have been playing the piano since I was young and eventually I was enrolled in piano lessons when I was 8.
        Piano is a passion of mine and I enjoy playing for others and teaching others how to play. I believe the piano is a gift that will only grow with the right people teaching piano lessons to the next generation. I want to be the reason that someone becomes inspired to play more, or at least give every child the opportunity to enjoy playing the piano.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music in general has always been a passion to me, and I enjoy sharing my talents with others. If there is a campfire and a guitar I'll try to play around as you can see in the picture.

      <h3>Contact Me/Payment</h3>
      <p>
        If you are interested in taking piano lessons, I would be happy to respond to an email or a phone call. I left my email and phone number at thew bottom of the page, so let me know if you want lessons and I will try to free up a spot for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am happy with any payment you choose to use, and you can choose what length you want each lesson to be. It is 25$ per 30 minutes, 35$ per 45 minutes, and 45$ for the hour.
